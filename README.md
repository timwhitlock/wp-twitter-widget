[http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/latest-tweets-widget](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/latest-tweets-widget)

## Installation

Note that the actual name of the plugin is "latest-tweets-widget" not "wp-twitter-widget". It's renamed on Github to differentiate it as a Wordpress plugin. 

Add the plugin to your Wordpress project via Git as follows:

    $ git submodule add https://github.com/timwhitlock/wp-twitter-widget.git \
       wp-content/plugins/latest-tweets-widget
    
If you want to use a stable release listed in the Wordpress plugin directory, you can checkout by tag, e.g.:

    $ cd wp-content/plugins/latest-tweets-widget 
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout tags/1.1.0

For further details on the plugin, please visit the [official plugin page](http://wordpress.org/plugins/latest-tweets-widget/).
